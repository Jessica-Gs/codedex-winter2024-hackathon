# MeowSpace Website
## About
This is a simple website built during the 48-hour Mini Holiday Hackathon hosted by Codedex during the winter of 2024. The intention of the website is to bring the user back to around the 1990s to early or mid 2000s.

## Why MeowSpace?
This website is called MeowSpace and is a spinoff of the original Myspace around the late 1990s to mid 2000s. It also centers around the gothic/punk/emo scene that swarmed Myspace during its time and resembles much of how a user at the time would have customized their profile, albeit with a feline twist. I had experience learning HTML and CSS around that time and realized as I was creating this project that I still use older HTML elements and techniques from back then that are no longer compatible to this day and age.

## Learning Experience
It has been a long time that I have dived into HTML/CSS or web development in general. Through this project I have learned how much both web development and web design has progressed over the years. I have also learned that there is a great deal that goes into making sure that a website is fully compatible with different screen sizes and browsers. I am sure that this website will not reach optimal levels of compatibility and it is something that I am excited to learn about going forward from this hackathon and learning more modern web development and design.

## Final Note - the Assets
The assets I had a lot of fun with, they are a mixture of edited photos of my family's cats and some of my friends' cats. The media player plays a song that was done by my brother's band during that time. The graphics are taken from various websites that I will credit below:
